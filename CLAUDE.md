## What This Is

A GPS-triggered AR anniversary app deployed as an Android APK via Capacitor. When the user is within 100 meters of a specific church in Manila (14.658888, 121.071173), the app activates a Three.js AR scene overlaid on the camera feed, showing fireworks and a spinning cylindrical marquee anchored to the church's physical location. The occasion: May 15, 2008 (wedding anniversary with "Bhaze").

## Build & Deploy

The entire build-and-deploy workflow is:
```bash
./serve_apk.sh
```
This runs `npx cap sync android`, builds the debug APK via Gradle, then serves it over WiFi on port 8000 so the phone can download and sideload it.

To run steps individually:
```bash
npx cap sync android          # sync web assets to Android project
cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug   # build APK only
```

The built APK lands at `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

There are no tests, no lint scripts, and no dev server—the app is static HTML.

## Architecture

Primary logic is split across two files: **`public/index.html`** (all JS, Three.js AR scene, GPS/sensor wiring) and **`android/app/src/main/java/com/alfie/anniversary/SensorBridgePlugin.java`** (Capacitor native plugin delivering GPS and orientation events with lower latency than the WebView APIs).

**Layered rendering (z-index stack):**
- `#camera-bg` (z=1): raw `<video>` element showing the rear camera
- `#ar-canvas` (z=2): Three.js WebGLRenderer canvas (alpha: true, so camera shows through)
- `#ui-layer` (z=3): "Locating…" status text shown before the experience triggers

**Experience trigger logic:**
- The native `SensorBridgePlugin` is the primary GPS and orientation source on Capacitor; `startWebGeoInterval()` (web geolocation `setInterval` at 3s) is the fallback when the native bridge does not deliver a location event within 2 seconds
- Triggers `startExperience()` when within 100m of `targetLat/targetLng`
- Secret: triple-tapping the invisible 100×100px `#secret-override` div (top-right corner) bypasses GPS and enters **test mode**, where the AR group spawns 40m ahead instead of over the real GPS coordinates. Each tap fires `navigator.vibrate(60)` for tactile confirmation; the third tap (which fires `startExperience`) uses pattern `navigator.vibrate([40, 60, 120])` so the wearer feels the bypass succeeded. The vibrate calls are typeof-guarded and no-op when the API is unavailable.
- While polling, the splash status text shows the live distance to the church (10m steps under 1 km, 0.1 km steps above) instead of static "Locating...". Permission/timeout/availability errors from `getCurrentPosition` surface human-readable copy in the same status line so a denied permission no longer looks like a hung app.

**3D scene structure (`createARGroup`):**
- A `THREE.Group` positioned at the GPS-calculated offset from the user (X=East, Z=North in Three.js)
- Pylon monument at shrine scale (~Quezon Memorial Shrine, ~66m): a "crown" message cylinder (`CylinderGeometry(35,35,12)`, 4096×512 canvas texture of the active site's marquee, `DoubleSide`) floating at world y≈50–62, capping four vertical stat **pylons**
- Four `PlaneGeometry` stat pylons (Years/Months/Hours/Days from the active site's anchor date) — tall columns of upright stacked glyphs (`_createPylonTexture`), ringed at 0°/90°/180°/270°, `translateZ(35)`, 50m tall (ground to world y≈50). An earlier "Tower of Light" tractor-beam cone was rejected as tacky — do not reintroduce light-beam forms
- `DeviceOrientationControls` ties the virtual camera to the phone's physical compass + gyroscope
- The compass-calibration banner is bounded by an 8-second timer; if `deviceorientationabsolute` never arrives the banner switches to "heading active" (when any `deviceorientation` event has been observed) or fades silently. The Three.js `DeviceOrientationControls` continues to drive the camera regardless of banner state.

**Fireworks system (`Firework` class):**
- Rockets use `THREE.LineSegments` for streak trails; explosions spawn 250–400 particles also rendered as line segments
- Three shell types: Peony, Willow, Chrysanthemum (affect particle count, velocity, gravity, streak length)
- `textIllumination` is a float that pulses the marquee/stat opacity brighter when a firework explodes within 150 units of the AR group

**`public/boids-app/` and `public/emitter-app/`** are completely independent static apps with no connection to the main experience. They are included in the Capacitor `webDir` but the main entry point is `public/index.html`.

## Key Constants

- `targetLat = 14.658888478751235`, `targetLng = 121.071173166497` — the church location (site id: `church`)
- `originLat = 14.651726103123695`, `originLng = 121.05472805488795` — the origin location (site id: `origin`); anchor date `2005-10-15`, marks when Alfie and Bhazel became a couple — the "monthsary" site, distinct from the 2008-05-15 wedding
- Trigger radius: 1800 m per site; the two sites are ~1.94 km apart so ranges overlap slightly — `nearestSite()` + the active-site lock guarantee exactly one site triggers
- The app is now multi-site: `SITES` array in `public/js/scene.js`, nearest in-range site (≤1800 m) triggers and locks for the session via `getActiveSite()`
- AR group spawn height: 15 meters (Y-axis); ground is at local y=−15
- Crown cylinder: radius 35 m, height 12 m, centered local y=41 (world ≈50–62 m)
- Stat pylons: `translateZ(35)`, height 50 m, centered local y=10 (ground to world ≈50 m)
- Wedding date: `new Date('2008-05-15T00:00:00')` (church site anchor)
- Monthsary date: `new Date('2005-10-15T00:00:00')` (origin site anchor)

## Capacitor Notes

- `capacitor.config.json`: `appId = com.alfie.anniversary`, `webDir = public`
- Do not manually edit files inside `android/` that Capacitor manages (e.g. `capacitor.settings.gradle`, `app/capacitor.build.gradle`). Run `npx cap sync` instead.
- The project uses `@capacitor/android` v8 with `@capacitor/core` v8, but `@capacitor/cli` v7—these are intentionally mismatched; do not "fix" them without testing.
